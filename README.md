Guess the Number Game

This is a simple C program for a "Guess the Number" game. The computer will randomly choose a number between 1 and 100, and your task is to guess that number. The program will provide hints if your guess is too high or too low and will keep track of the number of attempts until you guess the correct number.

Instructions to Play:

1) Compile the C program:
gcc -o guess_the_number guess_the_number.c

2) Run the compiled executable:
./guess_the_number

The program will display a welcome message and inform you that it has chosen a random number between 1 and 100.

Enter your guess when prompted. If your input is not a valid number, the program will inform you and allow you to try again.

The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low and prompt you to guess again.

Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number. The program will inform you of the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

Enjoy the game and have fun!

Note: If you want to play the game again, simply run the compiled executable again, and the program will choose a new random number for you to guess.
